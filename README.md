# PixdosepiX-OpenKBP---2020-AAPM-Grand-Challenge-
The aim of the OpenKBP Challenge is to advance fair and consistent comparisons of dose prediction methods for knowledge-based planning (KBP). Participants of the challenge will use a large dataset to train, test, and compare their prediction methods, using a set of standardized metrics, with those of other participants.
